# Edge-Simulation-on-client-server

This introduces a novel client-server architecture for military surveillance systems that efficiently handles high-priority tasks. The system processes tasks from JSON files in real-time, dynamically calculating their priorities and managing them through an advanced threading model. Tasks are organized in a shared queue, sorted by urgency to meet operational needs. A custom-built simulator replaces traditional server dependencies, enhancing flexibility and responsiveness for complex tasks. This new system improves efficiency and supports critical military operations with timely and accurate data processing.
